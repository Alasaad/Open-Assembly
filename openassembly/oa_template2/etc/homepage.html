<h1> Welcome to Open Assembly </h1>

<p>
This is what internet democracy looks like. Our vision is to improve our democratic decision making with digital tools. With a digital tool to make decisions we will be more connected, more cohesive, and more
powerful. Join the convergence and make decisions on Open Assembly today. OA is designed and developed based
on the feedback of the activists that use this tool. You decide, we develop.

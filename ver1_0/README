UBUNTU INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING DEV VERSION

Make Sure you have all the requirements installed to run a development server.

The RabbitMQ broker and MongoDB server.

sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
sudo apt-get install mongodb-server

Of course this project requires PIP and VirtualEnv.

sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install virtualenv

Now setup the structure of the development folder and create the OA virtualenv

mkdir OA
cd OA
git clone git://github.com/fragro/Open-Assembly.git
mkdir OA_ENV
virtualenv OA_ENV
source OA_ENV/bin/activate
cd Open-Assembly
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd openassembly

Now Open Two Terminals and Run the Django/Celery Servers Concurrently

python manage.py syncdb (if this fails try it until it succeeds)
python manage.py runserver

python manage.py celeryd

Go To:

http://localhost:8000/setup_admin/

To create an administrative account with the username 'admin' and password 'password'. Now you can begin to create groups and
test content to develop on. Soon we will release an anonymized exported database to experiment with.

For more debug information in Celery, include:

python manage.py celeryd -l DEBUG
